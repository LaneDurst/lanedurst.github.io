        <h1>LaneDurst.Github.io is my personal portfolio website, designed and implemented, entirely by me.</h1>
        <h2>The website was implemented using Github's built-in Pages function, which allows each user to create a personal static-website hosted by github. <a href="https://pages.github.com/">[Documentation Here]</a></h2>
        <h2>In an effort to hone my CSS and HTML skills, I elected to forgo the recommended Jekyll libraries and frameworks such as react. Instead, this website is coded by hand in pure HTML/CSS.</h2>
        <h2>As a result, I have uncovered various features of CSS that I was previously unaware of. For instance, this website will change styling on a small enough screen! Try loading it on your phone, you will notice the homepage has 2 columns instead of 4. This was accomplished using the viewport meta tag on the HTML file and an @media query in the CSS file.</h2>

        <h2>I also used <a href="https://portfolio.adobe.com/examples/">portfolio.adobe.com</a> to find inspiration for many aspects of the website. This is a free serivce offered by adobe that showcases portfolio websites from various artists on the web. </h2>
        <h2>If you would like to look into the specifics of this website's implementation, feel free to check out the github repository. It can be found at the following link</h2>
