        <h1>CAMI - A car lookup application</h1>
        <h2>CAMI is the name of a car lookup application created as part of a User Interfaces course at LSU. It's primary function was to assist car salespeople by giving more detailed and pertinent information on a vehicle, by scanning a QR code on the vehicle using their phone.</h2>

                <h2>Despite being created as part of a user interface course, the application did actually function, though using mock-data. My primary responsibility on this project was the integration of the backend into the frontend, i.e. connecting queries and login processes to firebase, and assisting in designing the styling for the application.</h2>
                <h2>Additionally, the preperatory work for this project also included in person interviews with actual car-salespeople from local dealerships. This served to allow for more accurate functional requirements and use cases for the application. </h2>
                <h2>If you would like to look into the specifics of this website's implementation, feel free to check out the github repository. It can be found at the following link</h2>
